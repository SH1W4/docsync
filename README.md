## ⚡ The Problem: Documentation Rot
In the age of agents, documentation isn't just for humans anymore. **Documentation rot** crashes autonomous workflows. When your AI Agent reads outdated or disorganized files, it hallucinates, fails at execution, and breaks the chain of truth.

## 🛡️ The Solution: DocSync Sovereign
**DocSync** is an enterprise-grade synchronization and validation engine designed for the **Sovereign Architect**. It treats documentation as a living, high-integrity database, sitting between your codebase and your LLMs to enforce precision and structural purity.

> *"Aumente o rigor. Garanta a verdade. Feed your Agent with DocSync."*

## 🏛️ Enterprise Architecture (Purified)
DocSync has undergone a **Sovereign Root Purification**, separating core logic from auxiliary research to provide a clean, high-fidelity experience:

- **`src/`**: High-performance core logic.
- **`docs/`**: Professional documentation and quickstarts.
- **`configs/`**: Standardized synchronization templates.
- **`archive/`**: Preserved historical and research data.
- **`legacy_tools/`**: Specialized maintenance scripts.

## 🔥 Key Capabilities

### 🔌 1. Native MCP Server (Model Context Protocol)
DocSync exposes your entire documentation knowledge base as a structured **MCP Server**.
*   **Agent Integration:** Connect DocSync to Claude, Cursor, or any MCP client for autonomous "read", "search", and "patch" operations.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Instantly provide your agents with the ground truth of your repository.

### 🧠 2. AI-Driven Semantic Validation
DocSync uses **LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)** to enforce content integrity:
*   **Consistency:** Verify if READMEs match real code implementation.
*   **Tone & Rigor:** Audit technical documentation for professional status and clarity.
*   **Executability:** Ensure installation steps in docs are logically sound and reproducible.

### 🔄 3. High-Stability Multi-OS Sync
Engineered for the nomadic architect, featuring:
*   **Win32/Linux/MacOS Harmony:** Fixed critical async file handling issues for ultimate stability across all hardware.
*   **Thread-Safe Copying:** Robust `shutil` fallback for enterprise file operations.
*   **Nested Config Support:** Industry-leading configuration parsing for complex organizations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install docsync
```

### 1-Click Manifestation
Turn your folder into a sovereign knowledge server instantly:
```bash
docsync serve --port 8000
```

### 🛠️ Professional CLI
```bash
task install   # Zero-config setup
task test      # High-fidelity testing
task lint      # Structural quality audit
task serve     # Manifest the MCP Server
```

## 🚀 CI/CD: Enterprise Grade
Our pipeline enforces a **Zero-Failure Quality Gate**:
- **Automated Matrix:** Tested on Python 3.9-3.12 across Windows and Ubuntu.
- **Strict Linting:** Ruff, Black, and Mypy enforced at every commit.
- **Quality Seal:** 80%+ Test coverage mandatory for production release.
